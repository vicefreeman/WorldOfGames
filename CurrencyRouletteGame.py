# This game will use the free currency api to get the current exchange rate from USD to ILS,
# will generate a new random number between 1-100 a will ask the user what he thinks is the value
# of the generated number from USD to ILS,
# depending on the userâ€™s difficulty his answer will be correct if the guessed value is between
# the interval surrounding the correct answer
# Properties
# 1. Difficulty
# Methods
# 1. get_money_interval -Will get the current currency rate from USD to ILS and will generate an interval as follows:
# a. for given difficulty d, and total value of money t the interval will be: (t - (5 - d), t + (5 - d))
# 2. get_guess_from_user - A method to prompt a guess from the user to enter a guess of value to a given amount of USD
# 3. play - Will call the functions above and play the game. Will return True / False if the user lost or won.
